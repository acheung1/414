*Do your project work here.*

Project 1 in particular is sensitive to what directory it is run in (as the
current directory is included as an environment variable, and environment
variables take up space in memory, thereby potentially shifting the stack).

We will be grading project-1 by running the vulnerable programs in a directory
called ~/cmsc414/p1-buffer

We recommend you do the same.

Have fun, and be safe!
